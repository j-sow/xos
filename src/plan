Basic 2 operand operators - as needed -trivial

iostream operators - necessary, but not a huge priority due to implicit
std::string conversions

directory_entry, directory_iterator, begin and end.. HIGH PRIORITY SOON

file_status - higher than directory_entry

enums file_type, perms, copy_options, directory_options - necessary, but only if blocking something, plus not much work

is_empty() - high prio
is_other() - high prio
is_regular_file() - high prio

->filetime - oportunity to mix-in some good posix compatible code, perhaps WP on it

status()
file_status()
system_complete()
temp_directory_path()
