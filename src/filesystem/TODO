- path root_name, root_directory, and root_path testing and sorting out...
  Haven't looked at in enough close detail to figure out if its sane
- path class utf16 & utf32/ucs4 -> whatever conversion (need working codecvt
  classes)
- path << & >> operators - need quoted() from c++ 14
- path template construction and mutation functions - we now work with utf8
  strings, plus utf-any construction, but it isn't enough
- u8path() - wtf is it for? - probably windoze only use, but *shrug*
- replace_extension()
- root_path() - think it always returns '/'

- unit tests for directory_entry comparison operators
- unit tests for file_status copy & move ctors and assignment operators
- unit tests for bool is_whatever(file_status) (fs_operations.h)

- figure out a cheap way of checking # of entries in a directory
